## Challenge Statement

In Arkansas, thousands of people have talent, but limited access to opportunity. Small businesses make up **99.3% of all enterprises (≈ 258,000)**, yet the state still ranks **40th out of 51** in overall economic activity.

Rising costs mean many small business owners skip professional services — not because they lack vision, but because every dollar goes toward staying open. At the same time, college students and freelancers across Little Rock possess valuable skills they can’t fully use or afford to market.  

The problem isn’t a lack of ability. it’s a **lack of access**.  

**$wap** addresses this by asking:  
- How might we help communities unlock value without relying on money?  
- How might we turn *“what you can do”* into *“what you need”*?  
- How might AI connect people so skills never go unused?
  
## Project Description  

**$wap** is an AI-powered skill-exchange platform that lets people **trade skills instead of cash**. It creates a new, inclusive economy where your abilities — not your wallet — open doors.  

### How It Works  
1. **Create a Profile** — List the skills you can offer and what you need.  
2. **AI Matchmaking** — Machine learning pairs you with users whose skills and availability fit yours.  
3. **Swap Fairly** — Exchange services, time, or expertise — no money required.  
4. **Earn & Redeem Credits** — Every successful swap earns credibility and “swap credits.”  
5. **Build Trust** — Ratings and feedback verify quality and accountability.  

### Example  
A college student in Little Rock who codes websites can trade with a hairstylist who needs a site.  
She builds the website; he braids her hair.  
No cash — just community, fair value, and mutual growth.

## Why It Matters to Little Rock and Arkansas  

- **Small Business Owners** often skip marketing or tech services because every dollar counts.  
- **College Students** need real-world experience but can’t afford mentorship or tools.  
- **Freelancers & Creators** have skills that sit idle without capital or visibility.  

By turning skills into currency, **$wap activates Arkansas’s underused talent** and fosters a local economy built on collaboration and trust — not cash.

## Unique Value Proposition  

Traditional freelance platforms require money, subscriptions, and transaction fees.  
**$wap reimagines value exchange as reciprocity, not currency.**  

- No middlemen — only fair exchange.  
- No barriers — anyone can start with what they know.  
- No limits — skills build community wealth.  

For **small businesses**, it means affordable growth.  
For **freelancers**, it means stronger portfolios and networks.  
For **college students**, it means real-world experience without debt.

- **`both`**: Search everything

**Request:**
```json
{
  "query": "someone who can help me understand how to make beats and produce music",
  "mode": "offers",
  "limit": 5
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
  {
    "uid": "dj_carlos",
    "display_name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
    "email": "carlosr.beats@gmail.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "I teach music production using FL Studio and Ableton. I can show you how to make trap, hip-hop, and R&B instrumentals.",
    "services_needed": "Want to get better at video editing, especially transitions and color grading",

    "city": "Conway",
    "score": 0.87
  },
  {
    "uid": "melody_davis",
    "display_name": "Melody Davis",
    "email": "melody.davis@outlook.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "Can teach you music theory, sound design, and how to mix your own tracks professionally",
    "services_needed": "Looking for someone to teach me content writing and copywriting",
    "city": "Jonesboro",
    "score": 0.82
  }
]
```

Score ranges from 0 to 1 (higher = better match).

**More examples:**

Looking for a language tutor:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "someone who speaks French fluently and can teach me conversational French",
    "mode": "offers",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

    "query": "I know JavaScript and React, looking for people who want to learn web development",
    "mode": "needs",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

General search:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "cooking and baking skills",
    "mode": "both",
    "limit": 8
  }'
```

---

#### 4. Skill Recommendation API

**Endpoint:** `POST /search/recommend-skills`

Get personalized skill recommendations based on what you already know. Analyzes profiles with similar skills and suggests complementary skills that are commonly learned together.

**Algorithm:**
1. Encode your current skills using BERT
2. Search for profiles with similar skill sets
3. Extract skills from those profiles (both what they offer and need)
4. Rank by frequency and relevance score
5. Return top recommendations

**Request:**
```json
{
  "current_skills": "Python programming and web development",
  "limit": 5
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
  {
    "skill": "SQL databases and data modeling",
    "score": 0.845,
    "reason": "Common among 12 similar profiles"
  },
  {
    "skill": "Docker containerization and deployment",
    "score": 0.732,
    "reason": "Common among 8 similar profiles"
  },
  {
    "skill": "Git version control and collaboration",
    "score": 0.698,
    "reason": "Common among 10 similar profiles"
  }
]
```

**Try it:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search/recommend-skills \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "current_skills": "JavaScript and React development",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

**Features:**
- Cached for 2 hours for fast repeat queries
- Smart scoring balances frequency and semantic relevance
- Filters out vague or too-short skills
- Useful for skill gap analysis and learning path planning

---

#### 5. Reciprocal Matching API

**Endpoint:** `POST /match/reciprocal`

Find mutual skill exchange partners where **you teach them** and **they teach you**.

**Algorithm:**
1. Search **their offers** vs **your needs** → Score A
2. Search **your offers** vs **their needs** → Score B  
3. Calculate **harmonic mean**: `2 × (A × B) / (A + B)`
4. Rank by combined score

**Why Harmonic Mean?**
Penalizes one-sided matches. Both scores need to be high.
- Good match: `(0.9, 0.9) → 0.90`
- One-sided: `(0.9, 0.3) → 0.45`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "my_offer_text": "I can teach web development, specifically building sites with React and handling databases",
  "my_need_text": "Want to learn acoustic guitar, maybe some basic music theory too",
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
