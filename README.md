## Challenge Statement

In Arkansas, thousands of people have talent, but limited access to opportunity. Small businesses make up **99.3% of all enterprises (≈ 258,000)**, yet the state still ranks **40th out of 51** in overall economic activity.

Rising costs mean many small business owners skip professional services — not because they lack vision, but because every dollar goes toward staying open. At the same time, college students and freelancers across Little Rock possess valuable skills they can’t fully use or afford to market.  

The problem isn’t a lack of ability. it’s a **lack of access**.  

**$wap** addresses this by asking:  
- How might we help communities unlock value without relying on money?  
- How might we turn *“what you can do”* into *“what you need”*?  
- How might AI connect people so skills never go unused?
  
## Project Description  

**$wap** is an AI-powered skill-exchange platform that lets people **trade skills instead of cash**. It creates a new, inclusive economy where your abilities — not your wallet — open doors.  

### How It Works  
1. **Create a Profile** — List the skills you can offer and what you need.  
2. **AI Matchmaking** — Machine learning pairs you with users whose skills and availability fit yours.  
3. **Swap Fairly** — Exchange services, time, or expertise — no money required.  
4. **Earn & Redeem Credits** — Every successful swap earns credibility and “swap credits.”  
5. **Build Trust** — Ratings and feedback verify quality and accountability.  

### Example  
A college student in Little Rock who codes websites can trade with a hairstylist who needs a site.  
She builds the website; he braids her hair.  
No cash — just community, fair value, and mutual growth.

## Why It Matters to Little Rock and Arkansas  

- **Small Business Owners** often skip marketing or tech services because every dollar counts.  
- **College Students** need real-world experience but can’t afford mentorship or tools.  
- **Freelancers & Creators** have skills that sit idle without capital or visibility.  

By turning skills into currency, **$wap activates Arkansas’s underused talent** and fosters a local economy built on collaboration and trust — not cash.

## Unique Value Proposition  

Traditional freelance platforms require money, subscriptions, and transaction fees.  
**$wap reimagines value exchange as reciprocity, not currency.**  

- No middlemen — only fair exchange.  
- No barriers — anyone can start with what they know.  
- No limits — skills build community wealth.  

For **small businesses**, it means affordable growth.  
For **freelancers**, it means stronger portfolios and networks.  
For **college students**, it means real-world experience without debt.

### Data Flow

**Profile Creation:**
```
User Input → FastAPI Validation → Firebase (store profile)
                                 ↓
                          ML Model (encode skills)
                                 ↓
                          Qdrant (store vectors)
```

**Semantic Search:**
```
Query "guitar lessons" → ML Model (text → 384-dim vector)
                              ↓
                       Qdrant (vector similarity search)
                              ↓
                       Firebase (fetch full profiles)
                              ↓
                       Ranked Results (by cosine similarity)
```

**Reciprocal Matching:**
```
My Skills: "Python"  }
My Needs: "Guitar"   } → ML Model → 2 vectors
                              ↓
                    ┌─────────┴──────────┐
                    ▼                    ▼
           Search their offers    Search my offers
           vs my needs           vs their needs
                    │                    │
                    └─────────┬──────────┘
                              ▼
                    Harmonic Mean Score
                              ↓
                    Top Mutual Matches
```

### Performance

| Operation | Cached | Uncached | Components Used |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Semantic Search | ~5ms | ~80ms | FastAPI → ML → Qdrant → Firebase |
| Reciprocal Match | ~8ms | ~120ms | FastAPI → ML → Qdrant (2x) → Firebase |
| Profile Create | - | ~150ms | FastAPI → Firebase → ML → Qdrant |
| Profile Read | - | ~20ms | FastAPI → Firebase |
| Health Check | - | ~1ms | FastAPI only |

*Tested on: Fly.io (1GB RAM, 1 CPU), 1000+ profiles*

**Note:** Redis caching speeds up repeat queries by ~16x. Currently only running in local dev (docker-compose), not deployed to production yet.

- **`needs`**: Find people who want to learn what you know
- **`both`**: Search everything

**Request:**
```json
{
  "query": "someone who can help me understand how to make beats and produce music",
  "mode": "offers",
  "limit": 5
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[

    "display_name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
    "email": "carlosr.beats@gmail.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "I teach music production using FL Studio and Ableton. I can show you how to make trap, hip-hop, and R&B instrumentals.",
    "services_needed": "Want to get better at video editing, especially transitions and color grading",
    "bio": "Producer and DJ, been making beats for 8 years",
    "city": "Conway",

    "city": "Jonesboro",
    "score": 0.82
  }
]
```

Score ranges from 0 to 1 (higher = better match).

**More examples:**

    "limit": 8
  }'
```

#### 4. Reciprocal Matching API

**Endpoint:** `POST /match/reciprocal`

Find mutual skill exchange partners where **you teach them** and **they teach you**.

**Algorithm:**
1. Search **their offers** vs **your needs** → Score A
2. Search **your offers** vs **their needs** → Score B  
3. Calculate **harmonic mean**: `2 × (A × B) / (A + B)`
4. Rank by combined score

**Why Harmonic Mean?**
Penalizes one-sided matches. Both scores need to be high.
- Good match: `(0.9, 0.9) → 0.90`
- One-sided: `(0.9, 0.3) → 0.45`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "my_offer_text": "I can teach web development, specifically building sites with React and handling databases",
  "my_need_text": "Want to learn acoustic guitar, maybe some basic music theory too",
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
