## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
We built Swap to help people share and monetize short, teachable skills in a trusted community marketplace. Primary challenge statements we targeted:

- How might we provide an accessible, discoverable marketplace for people to teach and trade short skills locally and remotely?
- How might we enable creators to package micro-services (skills) with clear deliverables and pricing so buyers can quickly find the right tutor or contributor?
- How might we reduce friction for onboarding, discovery, and secure transactions for peer-to-peer skill exchange?

## Project Description 🤯
Swap is a dark-themed, responsive web app where users can post short teachable skills, browse offerings, and request services from creators. The app includes an onboarding flow, a dashboard, a discover grid, and a post-skill form that captures title, description, logistics, tags, and deliverables.

How it works (high level):

- Creators sign up, describe a skill, and list deliverables, estimated hours, availability, and tags.
- Seekers browse the discover page or search, preview a listing, then request or book the service.
- The platform facilitates messaging/requests and (optionally) payment flow (placeholder for payment provider).

## Project Value 💰
Target users:

- Primary: independent creators, freelancers, and hobbyists who want to teach or sell short services.
- Secondary: people seeking fast, affordable, targeted instruction or delivery of small tasks.

Benefits:

- For Creators: quick listing flow, discoverability via tags, and built-in deliverable templates to reduce friction posting services.
- For Buyers: concise previews, clear deliverables, and simple request workflow to reduce time-to-purchase.
- For Communities: enables micro-entrepreneurship and skill-sharing in local and remote contexts.
