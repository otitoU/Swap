## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
We built Swap to help people share and monetize short, teachable skills in a trusted community marketplace. Primary challenge statements we targeted:

- How might we provide an accessible, discoverable marketplace for people to teach and trade short skills locally and remotely?
- How might we enable creators to package micro-services (skills) with clear deliverables and pricing so buyers can quickly find the right tutor or contributor?
- How might we reduce friction for onboarding, discovery, and secure transactions for peer-to-peer skill exchange?

## Project Description 🤯
$wap is a dark-themed, responsive web app where users can post short teachable skills, browse offerings, and request services from creators. The app includes an onboarding flow, a dashboard, a discover grid, and a post-skill form that captures title, description, logistics, tags, and deliverables.

How it works (high level):

- Creators sign up, describe a skill, and list deliverables, estimated hours, availability, and tags.
- Seekers browse the discover page or search, preview a listing, then request or book the service.
- The platform facilitates messaging/requests and (optionally) payment flow (placeholder for payment provider).

## Project Value 💰
Target users:

- Primary: independent creators, freelancers, and hobbyists who want to teach or sell short services.
- Secondary: people seeking fast, affordable, targeted instruction or delivery of small tasks.

Benefits:

- For Creators: quick listing flow, discoverability via tags, and built-in deliverable templates to reduce friction posting services.
- For Buyers: concise previews, clear deliverables, and simple request workflow to reduce time-to-purchase.
- For Communities: enables micro-entrepreneurship and skill-sharing in local and remote contexts.

curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/profiles/upsert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "uid": "marcus_williams",
    "email": "marcus.w@email.com",
    "display_name": "Marcus Williams",

```

**Try it:**
```bash
curl https://swap-backend.fly.dev/profiles/tyler_designs
```

---

#### 3. Semantic Search API

**Endpoint:** `POST /search`

Search for people using everyday language. The AI understands what you mean, not just keyword matching.

**Search Modes:**
- **`offers`**: Find people who can teach you something
- **`needs`**: Find people who want to learn what you know
- **`both`**: Search everything

**Request:**
```json
{
  "query": "someone who can help me understand how to make beats and produce music",
  "mode": "offers",
  "limit": 5
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
  {
    "uid": "dj_carlos",
    "display_name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
    "email": "carlosr.beats@gmail.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "I teach music production using FL Studio and Ableton. I can show you how to make trap, hip-hop, and R&B instrumentals.",
    "services_needed": "Want to get better at video editing, especially transitions and color grading",
    "bio": "Producer and DJ, been making beats for 8 years",
    "city": "Conway",
    "score": 0.87
  },
  {
    "uid": "melody_davis",
    "display_name": "Melody Davis",
    "email": "melody.davis@outlook.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "Can teach you music theory, sound design, and how to mix your own tracks professionally",
    "services_needed": "Looking for someone to teach me content writing and copywriting",
    "city": "Jonesboro",
    "score": 0.82
  }
]
```

The **score** shows how well someone matches your search (0 to 1, higher is better).

**More examples:**

Looking for a language tutor:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "someone who speaks French fluently and can teach me conversational French",
    "mode": "offers",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

Want to teach your coding skills:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "I know JavaScript and React, looking for people who want to learn web development",
    "mode": "needs",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

General search:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "cooking and baking skills",
    "mode": "both",
    "limit": 8
  }'
```

---

#### 4. Reciprocal Matching API

**Endpoint:** `POST /match/reciprocal`

Find mutual skill exchange partners where **you teach them** and **they teach you**.

**Algorithm:**
1. Search **their offers** vs **your needs** → Score A
2. Search **your offers** vs **their needs** → Score B  
3. Calculate **harmonic mean**: `2 × (A × B) / (A + B)`
4. Rank by combined score

**Why Harmonic Mean?**
It ensures both people benefit equally. A one-sided match gets penalized.
- Good match: `(0.9, 0.9) → 0.90` ✅ 
- One-sided: `(0.9, 0.3) → 0.45` ❌

**Request:**
```json
{
  "my_offer_text": "I can teach web development, specifically building sites with React and handling databases",
  "my_need_text": "Want to learn acoustic guitar, maybe some basic music theory too",
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
  {
    "uid": "brandon_strings",
    "display_name": "Brandon Hayes",
    "email": "brandonh.music@gmail.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "I teach acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and music theory for beginners and intermediate players",
    "services_needed": "Really want to learn web development so I can build my own website for my music lessons",
    "bio": "Guitarist in Hot Springs, been playing for 12 years",
    "city": "Hot Springs",
    "score": 0.91
  },
  {
    "uid": "jasmine_codes",
    "display_name": "Jasmine Parker",
    "email": "jasmine.p@outlook.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "Can teach you piano basics and how to read sheet music",
    "services_needed": "Need help understanding how to code and build web applications",
    "bio": "Piano teacher trying to transition to tech",
    "city": "Bentonville",
    "score": 0.78
  }
]
```

**Try it:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/match/reciprocal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "my_offer_text": "I can help with graphic design and teach you Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator",
    "my_need_text": "Looking to learn how to bake bread and pastries from scratch",
    "limit": 10
