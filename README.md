## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
We built Swap to help people share and monetize short, teachable skills in a trusted community marketplace. Primary challenge statements we targeted:

- How might we provide an accessible, discoverable marketplace for people to teach and trade short skills locally and remotely?
- How might we enable creators to package micro-services (skills) with clear deliverables and pricing so buyers can quickly find the right tutor or contributor?
- How might we reduce friction for onboarding, discovery, and secure transactions for peer-to-peer skill exchange?

## Project Description 🤯
$wap is a dark-themed, responsive web app where users can post short teachable skills, browse offerings, and request services from creators. The app includes an onboarding flow, a dashboard, a discover grid, and a post-skill form that captures title, description, logistics, tags, and deliverables.

How it works (high level):

- Creators sign up, describe a skill, and list deliverables, estimated hours, availability, and tags.
- Seekers browse the discover page or search, preview a listing, then request or book the service.
- The platform facilitates messaging/requests and (optionally) payment flow (placeholder for payment provider).

## Project Value 💰
Target users:

- Primary: independent creators, freelancers, and hobbyists who want to teach or sell short services.
- Secondary: people seeking fast, affordable, targeted instruction or delivery of small tasks.

Benefits:

- For Creators: quick listing flow, discoverability via tags, and built-in deliverable templates to reduce friction posting services.
- For Buyers: concise previews, clear deliverables, and simple request workflow to reduce time-to-purchase.
- For Communities: enables micro-entrepreneurship and skill-sharing in local and remote contexts.

```

---

#### 3. Semantic Search API

**Endpoint:** `POST /search`

Find users by natural language query using AI-powered semantic matching.

**Search Modes:**
- **`offers`** (default): Find people who **can teach** what you want to learn
- **`needs`**: Find people who **want to learn** what you can teach
- **`both`**: Search all skills (offers + needs)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "query": "teach me guitar and music production",
  "mode": "offers",
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
  {
    "uid": "musician_001",
    "display_name": "Mike Guitar",
    "email": "mike@example.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "Guitar, Music production, Audio engineering",
    "services_needed": "Web development, UI design",
    "bio": "Professional guitarist with 10 years experience",
    "city": "Lagos",
    "score": 0.89
  },
  {
    "uid": "producer_002",
    "display_name": "Sarah Beats",
    "email": "sarah@example.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "Music production, Piano, Sound design",
    "services_needed": "Python programming",
    "bio": "Music producer and audio engineer",
    "city": "Abuja",
    "score": 0.84
  }
]
```

**Score:** Float between 0.0 and 1.0 (higher = better semantic match)

**Examples:**

Find guitar teachers:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "learn guitar and music theory",
    "mode": "offers",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

Find people who want to learn Python:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Python programming and web development",
    "mode": "needs",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

Search everything:
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "photography",
    "mode": "both",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

#### 4. Reciprocal Matching API

**Endpoint:** `POST /match/reciprocal`

Find mutual skill exchange partners where **you teach them** and **they teach you**.

**Algorithm:**
1. Search **their offers** vs **your needs** → Score A
2. Search **your offers** vs **their needs** → Score B  
3. Calculate **harmonic mean**: `2 × (A × B) / (A + B)`
4. Rank by combined score

**Why Harmonic Mean?**
- Penalizes lopsided matches
- Both scores must be high for good match
- Example: `(0.9, 0.9) → 0.90` ✅ vs `(0.9, 0.3) → 0.45` ❌

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "my_offer_text": "Python programming, FastAPI, Machine Learning",
  "my_need_text": "Guitar lessons, Music theory, Songwriting",
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
  {
    "uid": "guitarist_dev",
    "display_name": "John Music",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "Guitar, Music theory, Songwriting",
    "services_needed": "Python, API development, Machine Learning",
    "bio": "Guitarist who wants to learn coding",
    "city": "Lagos",
    "score": 0.91
  },
  {
    "uid": "musician_coder",
    "display_name": "Lisa Tech",
    "email": "lisa@example.com",
    "skills_to_offer": "Piano, Music production",
    "services_needed": "Python, Web development",
    "bio": "Music teacher learning to code",
    "city": "Abuja",
    "score": 0.78
  }
]
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://swap-backend.fly.dev/match/reciprocal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "my_offer_text": "Python programming and web development",
    "my_need_text": "Guitar lessons and music production",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```
